# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to apply machine learning to solve credit card risk. Using a given dataset from LendingClub, we will be oversampling the data using **RandomOverSampler** and **SMOTE** algorithms, undersampling the data using **ClusterCentroids** algorithm, a combined approach of oversampling and undersampling using **SMOTEEN** algorithm, and lastly compare **BalancedRandomForestClassifier** and **EasyEnsembleClassifier** machine learning models to reduce bias.
